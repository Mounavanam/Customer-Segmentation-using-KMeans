# Customer-Segmentation-using-KMeans

This project uses K-Means clustering to segment customers based on data sourced from Kaggle. The goal is to identify distinct groups within the mall customers that share similar traits, which can help in targeted marketing strategies. This segmentation is based on customer features such as spending score, and income of customers.

### Technology Used
- Pandas: Used for data manipulation and analysis.
- NumPy: Utilized for numerical operations.
- Matplotlib and Seaborn: Employed for data visualization, helping to unterpret the clusters and the distribution of data points visually.
- Scikit-learn: KMeans clustering algorithm from this library is used to perform the segmentation.
